# 📔 Ryn's Magic Journal

Hi! 👋 This is a special computer book about **Ryn**. It has pictures, stories, and cool moving things!

We built this using **React** (which is like magical building blocks for websites).

## 🚀 How to Make It Go

To see the magic book on your computer, you need to do three easy steps:

1.  **Open the Box**: Open your computer terminal (it looks like a hacker screen!).
2.  **Wake Up the Robot**: Type this special magic word and press Enter:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  **Look**: Click the link that appears (it looks like `http://localhost:5173`).

## ✨ What's Inside?

-   **Hero**: A big welcome page with Ryn's name!
-   **Skills**: Cards that float and show what Ryn is good at (like singing and making bracelets!).
-   **Gallery**: A photo album where you look at pictures.
-   **More Info**: Fun facts about Ryn.
-   **Contact**: Buttons to say "Hello!" on Facebook or TikTok.

## 🛠️ For Grown-Ups (Tech Stuff)

If you are a big kid, here is what we used:
-   **Vite**: Makes it fast! ⚡
-   **TypeScript**: Makes sure we don't make mistakes. 🛡️
-   **Framer Motion**: Makes things wiggle and float. 🎈

Have fun looking around! 🍷✨
